anyways, they obfuscate their code with obfuscator.io and then used an eval obfuscator
an example on what it looks like obfuscated -> assets\js\entry.js
what it looks like deobfuscated -> assets\js\knimations.js

im posting this because they have a big ego for nothing
suck it you crack heads
you all have abandonment issues
